				<h3>Intro to HTTP</h3>
				<p>
					HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is like a messenger for the
					internet. Imagine your computer (or phone)
					is sending a letter to another computer, asking for a webpage. This
					letter is the HTTP request. The other
					computer, which stores the webpage, sends back another letter, which
					is the HTTP response, along with the
					webpage you wanted.
				</p>
				<p>
					HTTP works on a client-server model, where the client (your browser)
					initiates a request, and the server
					provides the requested content. It's a stateless protocol, meaning
					each request is independent, and the server
					doesn't retain information about past requests from the same client.
					To enhance security, websites often use
					HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which adds a layer of encryption (SSL/TLS) to
					the communication to protect data during
					transit.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, the interesting part is that these computers talk in a specific
					language, like saying "Get me this
					webpage" and "Here is the webpage you asked for." This communication
					allows you to see and interact with
					websites. It's the basic language they use to share information.
					Sometimes, to make it more secure, they use
					HTTPS, like putting your letter in a special envelope so no one else
					can read it on the way.
				</p>

				<h3>Intro to Cookies</h3>
				<p>
					Cookies, small text pieces sent to your browser by visited websites,
					play a crucial role in enhancing user
					experience. As part of the HTTP protocol, these cookies are
					typically established by the web server through
					the 'Set-Cookie' HTTP header in the server's response. Their purpose
					is to store information about your visit,
					aiding websites in remembering preferences and making subsequent
					visits more convenient and beneficial for
					users.
